# CSV to Markdown Table Converter

Converts CSV files to Markdown tables.

## Description

This simple script takes a CSV file and prints its contents in a Markdown table format. The script reads the CSV headers and then outputs each row in the Markdown table format.

## Requirements

- Python

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the script.
3. Run the script using the command below:

```bash
python script_name.py
```
Replace `script_name.py` with the actual name of the script.

4. When prompted, provide the full path to the CSV file you want to convert.

Example:
```
Enter the file path for the CSV file: /path/to/your/csvfile.csv
```

5. The script will then output the CSV data in a Markdown table format. Copy and paste the output into your Markdown file or document.

## Output Format

The output will look something like:

```
| Header1 | Header2 | Header3 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| data1 | data2 | data3 |
| data4 | data5 | data6 |
...
```
